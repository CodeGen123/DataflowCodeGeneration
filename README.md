# DataflowCodeGeneration
This is a code generator for the data flow model, which is now used on Ptolemy-II.


The example models are in the "SampleModel" folder, which includes thermostats and industrial examples.

The code generated by our generator is in the "generated" folder.

The code generated by Ptolemy-II is in the "CodeGeneratedByPtII" folder. It is worth noting that the code generator of Ptolemy-II is not enough to support industrial examples, so the code it generates is incomplete.

# How to use:
CodeGenerator.exe xxx.xml    e.g.  CodeGenerator.exe SampleModel\ModelFSM.xml

The code corresponding to the model will be generated in the "generated" folder.
